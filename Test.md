# Airbnb Software Test Plan

## 1. Test Plan Identifier
Airbnb Software System Test Plan Version 1.0

## 2. References
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Airbnb Software System

## 3. Introduction
This Test Plan delineates the approach, resources, and schedule intended for the testing activities of Airbnb software system. The aim is to ensure the reliability and quality of the software by testing all functionalities and features.

## 4. Test Items
The test items encompass all features and functionalities of the Airbnb software system as per the SRS document.

## 5. Software Risk Issues
Potential risks include inadequate test coverage, delays in schedule, and resource constraints. Contingency plans will be created to mitigate these risks.

## 6. Features to be Tested
Testing will be conducted on the following features:
- User registration and authentication
- Property search and listing
- Managing listings by hosts
- Booking management
- Payment management
- Review and rating management
- User profile management
- Communication features

## 7. Features not to be Tested
The non-functional aspects such as security, performance, and usability will be tested separately, and thus are not included in this Test Plan.

## 8. Approach
The approach for testing includes both manual and automated testing methods. Different types of tests like functional testing, system testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) will be performed.

## 9. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
Each feature will be tested against its requirements as stated in the SRS. A feature will be considered to have passed if it meets all its stated requirements. If it fails to meet any requirement, it will be deemed to have failed and will be revised accordingly.

## 10. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
In case critical defects are identified that hinder further testing, the testing activities may be suspended. Once these defects are fixed and retested, testing will resume.

## 11. Test Deliverables
The test deliverables will include:
- Test plan document
- Test cases and test scripts
- Test reports and summaries

## 12. Remaining Test Tasks
The remaining testing tasks encompass:
- Designing of test cases
- Setting up of test environment
- Execution of tests
- Reporting and tracking of defects
- Regression testing
- User acceptance testing

## 13. Environmental Needs
The environment for testing will include:
- Hardware: Computers, mobile devices
- Software: Web browsers, operating systems
- Test management tools: TestRail, Jira

## 14. Staffing and Training Needs
The testing team will need to be adequately trained on the testing tools and techniques that will be used for testing the Airbnb software system.

## 15. Responsibilities
The testing team will be in charge of:
- Test planning and design
- Test execution and reporting
- Managing and resolving defects

## 16. Schedule
The testing activities will be carried out concurrently with the development process, in accordance with the project timeline and milestones.

## 17. Planning Risks and Contingencies
Potential risks include insufficient test coverage, delays in schedule, and resource constraints. Contingency plans will be established to address these risks.

## 18. Approvals
This test plan needs approval from the project stakeholders before the commencement of testing activities.
